				<p class="poetry"><i>This is the night when I must die</i>,<br/>
				<i>And great Orion walketh high</i><br/>
				<i>In silent glory overhead</i>:<br/>
				<i>He’ll set just after I am dead</i>.</p>
				<p class="poetry"><i>A week this night</i>, <i>I’m in my grave</i>:<br/>
				<i>Orion walketh o’er the wave</i>:<br/>
				<i>Down in the dark damp earth I lie</i>,<br/>
				<i>While he doth march in majesty</i>.</p>
				<p class="poetry"><i>A few weeks hence and spring will come</i>;<br/>
				<i>The earth will bright array put on</i><br/>
				<i>Of daisy and of primrose bright</i>,<br/>
				<i>And everything which loves the light</i>.</p>
				<p class="poetry"><i>And some one to my child will say</i>,<br/>
				“<i>You’ll soon forget that you could play</i><br/>
				<i>Beethoven</i>; <i>let us hear a strain</i><br/>
				<i>From that slow movement once again</i>.”</p>
				<p class="poetry"><i>And so she’ll play that melody</i>,<br/>
				<i>While I among the worms do lie</i>;<br/>
				<i>Dead to them all</i>, <i>for ever dead</i>;<br/>
				<i>The churchyard clay dense overhead</i>.</p>
				<p class="poetry"><i>I once did think there might be mine</i><br/>
				<i>One friendship perfect and divine</i>;<br/>
				<i>Alas</i>! <i>that dream dissolved in tears</i><br/>
				<i>Before I’d counted twenty years</i>.</p>
				<p class="poetry"><i>For I was ever commonplace</i>;<br/>
				<i>Of genius never had a trace</i>;<br/>
				<i>My thoughts the world have never fed</i>,<br/>
				<i>Mere echoes of the book last read</i>.</p>
				<p class="poetry"><i>Those whom I knew I cannot blame</i>:<br/>
				<i>If they are cold</i>, <i>I am the same</i>:<br/>
				<i>How could they ever show to me</i><br/>
				<i>More than a common courtesy</i>?</p>
				<p class="poetry"><i>There is no deed which I have done</i>;<br/>
				<i>There is no love which I have won</i>,<br/>
				<i>To make them for a moment grieve</i><br/>
				<i>That I this night their earth must leave</i>.</p>
				<p class="poetry">Thus, moaning at the break of day,<br/>
				A man upon his deathbed lay;<br/>
				A moment more and all was still;<br/>
				The Morning Star came o’er the hill.</p>
				<p class="poetry">But when the dawn lay on his face,<br/>
				It kindled an immortal grace;<br/>
				As if in death that Life were shown<br/>
				Which lives not in the great alone.</p>
				<p class="poetry">Orion sank down in the west<br/>
				Just as he sank into his rest;<br/>
				I closed in solitude his eyes,<br/>
				And watched him till the sun’s uprise.</p>
